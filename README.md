# 🌿 Numi AI – Landing Page Redesign 

This is my submission for the **Bimi Internship Assignment**, focused on redesigning the [JoinNumi.com](https://joinnumi.com) landing page.

The goal was to reflect Numi AI's mission — helping users improve their mental health through tiny, personalized habits — using clean UI, emotional storytelling, and conversion-focused design.
